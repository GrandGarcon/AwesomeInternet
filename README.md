this repo will list  and discuss  the standards   formulated  by the  IETF 
1.  [Internet Protocols for the Smart Grid](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-baker-ietf-core-15)
   `although outdated , but still forms the basic of smart grid inudstry , will surely be trying to  implement the standards if time persisted.`<br>
   a. **the most prominent ones already build :- [Open smart grid project](https://github.com/OSGP/Documentation)<br>
   b. this infographic will make your work more convinient to visualize.** <br>[click here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiKvPXKzc7eAhVHzhoKHTKuBTAQjRx6BAgBEAU&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdocumentation.opensmartgridplatform.org%2FArchitecture%2FFunctionallayersoverview.html&psig=AOvVaw3ALR5McwRneyJHhEFXIPzF&ust=1542103557203390)



2. [Basic list of protocols  running WWW](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-baker-ietf-core-04.html) ` specially for those people having their basics in networking  quite weak`

3. [Autonomous network standards in the Internet](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7575/) `kind of optimistic  goals for network  to be implemented by the standards and language which resembles XML.` <br> 
   a. try to make some tutorials on this specification.

4. the I in the IOT :- [ this link]() consist of the important points that my professor discussed  in the last lecture  regarding the lates suite of protocols initiated by the developer community to adjust the networked things into the obsolete and resource hungry  IPV6.


5.[ RFC 7748 - elliptic curve security](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748) :- consist of  implpementation standard for curve25519 and X3DH
